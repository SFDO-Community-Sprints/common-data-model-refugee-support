Project Topic: “Build common data models that are commonly implemented in NGO/EDU to avoid duplicate work and promote collaboration and best practices
Group working topic: “Refugee Support Starter Pack”
Team members:

1. Ozge Oz 
2. John Buen

6. Juliet John


End Users:
Refugee
Charity Case Worker

Donor
Government Agencies



Notes from Ozge’s Experience:

- Education (kids/adult)
- Employment (work permit variations) 
- Childrens needs (same categories as above - taking into consideration children are constantly being required to move location/school) 
- Level of help required
- Accommodation - with ability to track accommodation history when people are moved often 
- Languages 
- All of this changes over time
- Touch point recording - calls, meetings, issues 
- Integration with official process (with flexibility to change parameters)
- Ability to track resources available and match up with refugee records
- Nationality - which will dictate what support the Government provides automatically
- Will need some sort of object to track government rules for each nationality
- Common database - how do we give access to multiple different NGOs to the same data set? - Can Migrant Help own the central database?
- Consent from Refugee to share data across organisations
- Refugee status will take at least 2 years (lasts for 5 years - after which you can apply for unlimited leave to remain, after one year of that you can apply for citizenship)

Project Report Back

What project are you working on?
Common Data Model - Refugee Support Starter Pack

What have you accomplished today?
Created a refugee timeline, agreed on a general data structure, researched current generic and scheme specific government policy, set up NPSP trial org with team admin access. 

What are your next steps?
Create detailed ERD (entity relation diagram), begin building trial NPSP org objects and fields

Any other details to share?(optional)
Is there a better way of setting up the test environment? The trial we have will only last a month, but using a development org instead will only allow 2 admins.
